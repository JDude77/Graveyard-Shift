What you gonna do about it? Cry? Because if so I'm sorry because I value our friendship more than jokes that are coming across as cruelty."		},		{			"lineID": "OverviewLongResidentsReplyNiceLine",			"text": "Definitely not, they're both good company. The ghost's a decent cleaner when they're not crying, and the werewolf is a great practical helper."		},		{			"lineID": "OverviewLongResidentsReplyPunLine",			"text": "...make another pun like that and I will show you a brand new definition of fear.
